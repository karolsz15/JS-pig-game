The game rules are below:

1. Two players take part in the game, they roll their dices in rounds 
2. In every single turn, one player rolls two dices as many times as he whishes. Every result is added to his ROUND score
3. BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
4. The player can choose to 'HOLD' the score, which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
5. The first player WHO reaches set amount of points in his GLOBAL score wins the game


Script was written in pure JavaScript, without using any JS framework. I used querySelector.addEventListener methods to manipulate the DOM. 
Various anonymous functions are run depending on which button is pressed.
User is allowed to see game rules, start a new game (at any moment!), roll the dices,
 hold the current score and set the final score, after which the game is over.
I changed the provided CSS stylesheet significantly, implemented icons and backgrund picture to make it look better. 
I made many adjustments in the app to be responsive (removed background image, hid some parts of the footer,
 changed font sizes, moved gaming dices' pictures significantlly, changed paddings and margins etc).
It works properly on tablets (e.g. iPad's screen resolition) and mobile phones (e.g. iPhone 6/7/8 screen resolutions).
